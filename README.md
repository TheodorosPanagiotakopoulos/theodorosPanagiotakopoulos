# Welcome to My GitHub

Hi there! üëã

I am a **PhD Candidate** pursuing my PhD in **Computational Material Science** at the University of Central Florida, specializing in developing **Machine Learning algorithms** for nanotechnology and material design.

## Industry Experience

- **ASML Silicon Valley**: Worked as a Modeling Product Engineer Intern, where I developed computational methods to optimize photomasks and enhanced simulation processes for pre-silicon fabrication, resulting in reduced memory usage and runtime.

## Research at University of Central Florida

- Developing **Deep Learning Classifiers** and **Neural Networks** for molecular dynamics and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, accelerating simulations for semiconductor fabrication processes and epitaxial metal growth on semiconductors.

- Modeling the **CO2 reduction reaction** in the presence of metallic and non-metallic cations, simulating cathodes and developing voltage-stabilizing algorithms, showing that HCOO‚Åª forms best via direct hydrogenation and CO via proton shuttling.

- Simulating the Hydrogen **Evolution Reaction (HER)**, showing that non-metallic cations exhibit lower activation barriers than metallic ones for hydrogen production, and engineering custom cathode simulation code and voltage-stabilizing algorithms.

- Engineering **ETL pipelines** for large-scale cleaning and preprocessing of simulation data, enabling efficient Data Analysis and facilitating meaningful result extraction.

## Teaching

I have worked as a **teaching assistant** at the University of Central Florida, teaching electrodynamics at both the graduate and undergraduate levels.

## Education

- **PhD in Computational Material Science** from the University of Central Florida.
- **Master's degree in Physics** from the University of Central Florida, focused on computational material design.
- **Master's degree** from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, with a focus on computational physics.
