# Welcome to My GitHub

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a **PhD Candidate** pursuing my PhD in **Computational Material Science** at the University of Central Florida, specializing in developing **Machine Learning algorithms** for nanotechnology and material design.

## Industry Experience  

### **ASML Silicon Valley (2025) â€“ Modeling Product Engineer Intern**  
- Engineered a **terabyte-scale CNN analysis pipeline**, scaling from **ThreadPoolExecutor** for I/O and **ProcessPoolExecutor** for compute to **Dask** to overcome DataFrame limits, cutting analysis time by **80%** and exposing critical overfitting.

- Trained a **ResNet-18 from scratch in PyTorch** with **metric learning (triplet loss)** to remediate uncovered overfitting by detecting redundant or near-duplicate images and rebalancing the train/validation split, achieving **target performance**.

- Implemented a **Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)** to solve the **2D Helmholtz equation**, achieving **high simulation accuracy** as a surrogate for traditional solvers.

### **ASML Silicon Valley (2024) â€“ Modeling Product Engineer Intern**  
- Optimized a **geometric simulation parameter**, reducing **runtime 5%** and **memory usage 10%** in production software used by **ASML customers**.

- Designed and executed **optimization experiments** for a core optical parameter, cutting **runtime 10%** and **memory usage 34%** in **ASMLâ€™s commercial release**.

- Developed **Python libraries and ETL pipelines** adopted by **ASMLâ€™s product engineering teams**, standardizing large-scale simulation **data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis**.

## Research at University of Central Florida

- Engineered **numerical methods** to model complex system properties and predict critical thresholds, establishing a **high-fidelity baseline** for predictive modeling.

- Developed a **two-stage PyTorch framework** that delivered highly accurate **energy predictions** for large-scale systems beyond traditional simulations, pivotal in securing **NSF research funding**.

- Implemented a **3D CNN in PyTorch** on **voxelized atomic data** to predict structural outcomes of deposition processes, accelerating simulations by producing accurate results in **seconds instead of hours**.

- Built a **Graph Neural Network (GNN) pipeline** for incomplete graphs, achieving **94% accuracy** on sparse data and reducing computational overhead in **material design simulations**.

- Automated **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training** by designing **end-to-end ETL and ML pipelines** in Python and Bash, improving iteration speed.

- Authored and maintained **three Python libraries** for **fabrication modeling, electrochemical simulations, and 3D-to-2D visualization**, adopted by **university engineering teams**.

- Devised a **voltage-control algorithm** for electrochemical simulations, reducing computational costs while generating **high-fidelity data** for predictive modeling.

- Established **analytical workflows** for complex **HPC simulation data**, uncovering novel **reaction mechanisms** and identifying root causes of enhanced **catalytic performance** in clean energy processes.

- Designed and deployed an **end-to-end data pipeline** to evaluate **COâ‚‚ reduction catalysts**, delivering key insights that guided experimental work and contributed to securing **DOE funding**.

- Debugged and optimized **software for materials science applications** on **Linux-based HPC systems**, accelerating data processing and reducing time to results.

- Created a centralized **SQL database** for **multi-GB simulation datasets**, improving data accessibility and accelerating validation across research teams.
