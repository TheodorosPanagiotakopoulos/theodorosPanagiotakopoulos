### Hi there üëã

I am a PhD Candidate pursuing my PhD in Computational Material Science at the University of Central Florida, specializing in developing Machine Learning algorithms  for nanotechnology and material design. 

I worked at ASML Silicon Valley as a Modeling Product Engineer Intern, where I developed computational methods for photomask optimization, enhancing simulations for pre-silicon fabrication processes.

My PhD research focuses on developing  Deep Learning Clasifiers, Neural Networks, for molecular dynamics and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, enhancing simulations for semiconductor fabrication processes and epitaxial metal growth on semiconductors. 

I am modeling the CO2 reduction reaction in the presence of metallic and non-metallic cations, simulating cathodes and developing voltage-stabilizing algorithms showing that HCOO‚Åª forms best via proton shuttling and CO via direct hydrogenation, overturning previous assumptions.
