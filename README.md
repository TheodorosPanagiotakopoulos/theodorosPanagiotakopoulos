# Welcome to My GitHub

Hi there! 👋

I **earned my PhD in Computational Material Science** at the **University of Central Florida**, specializing in developing **Machine Learning algorithms** for **nanotechnology** and **material design**.

## Industry Experience  

### **ASML Silicon Valley (2025) - Modeling Product Engineer Intern**  
- Engineered a **terabyte-scale CNN analysis pipeline**, scaling from **ThreadPoolExecutor** for I/O and **ProcessPoolExecutor** for compute to **Dask** to overcome DataFrame limits, cutting analysis time by **80%** and exposing critical overfitting.
  
- Trained a **ResNet-18 from scratch in PyTorch** with **metric learning (triplet loss)** to remediate uncovered overfitting by detecting redundant or near-duplicate images and rebalancing the train/validation split, achieving **target performance**.

- Augmented the **ResNet-18** dataset by training a **U-Net denoising diffusion model** to generate **minority-class images**, improving **class balance** and **validation generalization**.

### **ASML Silicon Valley (2024) - Modeling Product Engineer Intern**  
- Implemented a **Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)** to solve the **2D Helmholtz equation**, achieving **high simulation accuracy** as a surrogate for traditional solvers.

- Optimized a **geometric simulation parameter**, reducing **runtime 5%** and **memory usage 10%** in production software used by **ASML customers**.

- Built **Python libraries** and **PySpark ETL pipelines** adopted by **ASML product engineering teams** to standardize **cleaning and preprocessing** of **400+ GB** of **simulation metadata**.

## Research at University of Central Florida

- Developed a **two-stage PyTorch neural network surrogate** for **large-scale energy prediction** and **critical threshold identification**, trained on **high-fidelity baselines**, pivotal to securing **NSF funding**.
  
- Implemented a **3D CNN** to predict **atomic deposition structures** from **voxelized data**, reducing simulation latency from **hours to seconds** and outperforming a self-implemented **3D Vision Transformer** baseline.
  
- Trained a **3D U-Net denoising diffusion model** to synthesize **underrepresented voxelized deposition structures** for augmentation, improving **class/condition balance** and **3D CNN generalization**.
  
- Orchestrated a distributed **PySpark pipeline** converting **10K+ atomic configurations** into **600K+ 3D voxel tensors**, eliminating **data-ingestion bottlenecks** for **3D CNN training**.
  
- Built a **Graph Neural Network pipeline** for **incomplete graphs**, achieving **94% accuracy** on **sparse data** and reducing **computational overhead** in **material design simulations**.
  
- Engineered a high-performance **C++ solver**, using **hierarchical parallelism** with **Kokkos** and **TBB** and **compile-time unit safety** with **Boost.Units**, delivering **strong scaling** across **CPUs** and **GPUs**.
  
- Created a centralized **SQL database** for **multi-GB simulation datasets**, improving **data accessibility** and accelerating **validation** across **research teams**.
  
- Authored and maintained **three Python libraries** for **fabrication modeling**, **electrochemical simulations**, and **3D-to-2D visualization**, adopted by **university engineering teams**.
  
- Designed a **signal-processing pipeline** for **noisy electrochemical time-series** using **Savitzky–Golay smoothing** and **IQR rejection** to extract features, yielding results instrumental in **DOE funding**.
  
- Integrated **multi-GB HPC simulation outputs** with cleaned **electrochemistry time-series** to engineer **high-dimensional features** for **predictive modeling**, improving robustness to **noise** and **sparsity**.
